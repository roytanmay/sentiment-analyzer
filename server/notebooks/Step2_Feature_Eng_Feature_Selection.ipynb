       "0  *Disclaimer: I only watched this movie as a conditional agreement. And I see films for free. I wouldn't be caught dead giving my hard earned money to these idiots.Well, to explain the depth of this 'film', I could write my shortest review, ever. Don't see this movie. It is by far the stupidest, lamest, most lazy, and unbelievably UNFUNNY movie I have ever seen. It is a total disaster. But since my hatred for this movie, and the others like it, extends far beyond one viewing, I think I'll go on for a bit.I don't know any of the people in the movie besides Carmen Electra, Vanessa Minnillo, and Kim Kardashian, but it doesn't matter. They're all horrible, though I think that was the point. The editing is flat out horrible, and possibly blatant continuity errors make this crapfast even crappier than I thought it would be. Now I know that these films are not supposed to be serious at all, but come on, it's film-making 101 that if someone gets a minor facial cut, it should be there in the...   \n",
       "1  I am writing this in hopes that this gets put over the previous review of this \"film\". How anyone can find this slop entertaining is completely beyond me. First of all a spoof film entitled \"Disaster Movie\", should indeed be a spoof on disaster films. Now I have seen 1 (yes count them, 1) disaster film being spoofed, that being \"Twister\". How does Juno, Iron Man, Batman, The Hulk, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Amy Winehouse, or Hancock register as Disaster films? Selzterwater and Failburg once again have shown that they lack any sort of writing skill and humor. Having unfortunately been tortured with Date Movie and Epic Movie I know exactly what to expect from these two...no plot, no jokes just bad references and cheaply remade scenes from other films. Someone should have informed them that satire is more than just copy and paste from one film to another, though I shouldn't say that because some of these actually just seem to be taken from trailers.There is nothing clever or witty or re...   \n",
       "2  Really, I could write a scathing review of this turd sandwich, but instead, I'm just going to be making a few observations and points I've deduced.There's just no point in watching these movies anymore. Does any reader out there remember Scary Movie? Remember how it was original with a few comedic elements to it? There was slapstick, some funny lines, it was a pretty forgettable comedy, but it was worth the price of admission. Well, That was the last time this premise was funny. STOP MAKING THESE MOVIES. PLEASE.I could call for a boycott of these pieces of monkey sh*t, but we all know there's going to be a line up of pre pubescent annoying little buggers, spouting crappy one liners like, \"THIS IS SPARTA!\" and, \"IM RICK JAMES BITCH\" so these movies will continue to make some form of monetary gain, considering the production value of this movie looks like it cost about 10 cents to make.Don't see this movie. Don't spend any money on it. Go home, rent Airplane, laugh your ass off, and ...   \n",
       "3  If you saw the other previous spoof movies by these two horrible gentlemen, then you should know that this already will be bad. I'll tell you the truth, if you want to watch it as a brainless person (ironically meant for the stereotypical teenagers, which I am not) then you will laugh at it a bit. But if you judge it, even a little, the movie automatically fails. Why? Never ask that when it comes to these two men.Remember the good old Hollywood days whenever making a movie was about showing people a type of art, and also a story that kept you on the edge of your seat? Well whenever word hit that making films earned you loads of cash, then all these greedy people came in the picture and its quite pathetic. These two are no exception. We still have movie artists (most notably the genius that is Christopher Nolan). But these two guys just...well I've been writing so big words, let me put it in simple terms for these guys...These guys suck, they are not artists, but instead money cravi...   \n",

Burping, kicking in the groin and boobs all over the place. Lame. What is wrong with society, that films like this even get made? The parodies were all horrendous, and un-funny. The plot was lackluster at best and the acting was shallow, transparent and really quite unnecessary.Anyone see \"Idiocracy\"? Remember the movie that won all the academy awards in the future? Well this is that movie. I have not seen a more rancid crappy film. \"Date Movie\" was okay, The Scary movies at least had decent plots, but this, this makes \"spoofs\" (if I can be so nice to call it that) for this year 0 for 3, with \"Meet the Spartans\" and \"Superhero Movie\" all falling flat.Well I've wasted even more of my life typing about this sack of cow dung. So all in all, don't see this movie, unless of course your IQ is below 80.Thanks, R   \n",

       "0  * IsenÃ§Ã£o de responsabilidade: eu sÃ³ assisti esse filme como um acordo condicional. E eu vejo filmes de graÃ§a. Eu nÃ£o seria pego morto dando meu dinheiro suado a esses idiotas. Bem, para explicar a profundidade desse 'filme', eu poderia escrever minha crÃ­tica mais curta de todos os tempos. NÃ£o vÃª este filme. Ã de longe o filme mais estÃºpido, lamenta, preguiÃ§oso e inacreditavelmente UNFUNNY que eu jÃ¡ vi. Ã um desastre total. Mas como o meu Ã³dio por este filme e por outros, se estende muito alÃ©m de uma exibiÃ§Ã£o, acho que vou continuar um pouco. NÃ£o conheÃ§o nenhuma das pessoas do filme alÃ©m de Carmen Electra, Vanessa Minnillo, e Kim Kardashian, mas isso nÃ£o importa. Eles sÃ£o todos horrÃ­veis, embora eu ache que esse seja o ponto. A ediÃ§Ã£o Ã© horrÃ­vel e, possivelmente, erros de continuidade flagrantes tornam essa porcaria ainda mais horrÃ­vel do que eu pensava.

Antes de mais nada, um filme de parÃ³dia intitulado \"Filme de desastre\" deveria ser, de fato, uma parÃ³dia de filmes de desastre. Agora eu jÃ¡ vi 1 (sim, conte-os, 1) filme de desastre sendo falsificado, sendo \"Twister\". Como Juno, Homem de Ferro, Batman, O Hulk, Alvin e os Esquilos, Amy Winehouse ou Hancock se registram como filmes de Desastre? Selzterwater e Failburg mostraram mais uma vez que nÃ£o possuem nenhum tipo de habilidade e humor de escrita. Infelizmente, tendo sido torturado com Date Movie e Epic Movie, sei exatamente o que esperar desses dois ... nenhum enredo, nenhuma piada, apenas mÃ¡s referÃªncias e cenas refeitas de outros filmes. AlguÃ©m deveria ter informado a eles que a sÃ¡tira Ã© mais do que apenas copiar e colar de um filme para outro, embora eu nÃ£o deva dizer isso porque algu...   \n",
       "2  Realmente, eu poderia escrever uma crÃ­tica contundente sobre esse sanduÃ­che de cocÃ´, mas, em vez disso, vou fazer algumas observaÃ§Ãµes e pontos que deduzi. NÃ£o hÃ¡ mais sentido assistir a esses filmes. Algum leitor por aÃ­ se lembra do filme de terror? Lembra como era original, com alguns elementos cÃ´micos? Havia palhaÃ§ada, algumas frases engraÃ§adas, era uma comÃ©dia bastante esquecÃ­vel, mas valia o preÃ§o da entrada. Bem, essa foi a Ãºltima vez que essa premissa foi engraÃ§ada. PARE DE FAZER ESTES FILMES. POR FAVOR, eu poderia pedir um boicote a esses pedaÃ§os de macaco, mas todos sabemos que haverÃ¡ uma fila de buggers irritantes e prÃ©-pubescentes, jorrando uns forros ruins como: \"ISTO Ã SPARTA!\" e \"IM RICK JAMES BITCH\", para que esses filmes continuem gerando algum ganho monetÃ¡rio, considerando que o valor de produÃ§Ã£o deste filme parece custar cerca de 10 centavos de dÃ³lar. NÃ£o gaste dinheiro com isso. VÃ¡ para casa, alugue a Airplane, ria e julgue silenciosament...   \n",
       "3  Se vocÃª viu os outros filmes falsificados anteriores por esses dois senhores horrÃ­veis, deve saber que isso jÃ¡ serÃ¡ ruim. Vou lhe dizer a verdade, se vocÃª quiser vÃª-lo como uma pessoa sem cÃ©rebro (ironicamente para os adolescentes estereotipados, o que eu nÃ£o sou), entÃ£o vocÃª rirÃ¡ um pouco. Mas se vocÃª julgar, mesmo que um pouco, o filme falha automaticamente. Por quÃª? Nunca pergunte isso quando se trata desses dois homens. Lembre-se dos bons e velhos tempos de Hollywood, sempre que fazer um filme era mostrar Ã s pessoas um tipo de arte e tambÃ©m uma histÃ³ria que o mantinha na ponta do seu assento? Bem, sempre que a notÃ­cia de que fazer filmes ganhava muito dinheiro, entÃ£o todas essas pessoas gananciosas apareciam na imagem e Ã© bastante patÃ©tico. Esses dois nÃ£o sÃ£o exceÃ§Ã£o. Ainda temos artistas de filmes (principalmente o gÃªnio Christopher Nolan). Mas esses dois caras simplesmente ... bem, eu tenho escrito palavras tÃ£o grandes, deixe-me colocar em termos sim...   \n",
       "4             Este filme eu vi um dia cedo de graÃ§a e ainda sinto que fui enganado. Ã totalmente morte cerebral. Arrotando, chutando a virilha e os peitos por todo o lugar. Coxo. O que hÃ¡ de errado com a sociedade, que filmes como esse sÃ£o feitos? As parÃ³dias eram todas horrendas e pouco engraÃ§adas. O enredo foi sem brilho, na melhor das hipÃ³teses, e a atuaÃ§Ã£o foi superficial, transparente e realmente bastante desnecessÃ¡ria. AlguÃ©m vÃª \"Idiocracia\"? Lembra do filme que ganhou todos os prÃªmios da academia no futuro? Bem, este Ã© esse filme. Eu nÃ£o vi um filme de baixa qualidade mais ranÃ§oso. \"Date Movie\" foi bom, The Scary Movies pelo menos teve enredos decentes, mas isso faz \"spoofs\" (se Ã© que posso dizer assim) para este ano 0 para 3, com \"Meet the Spartans\" e \"Filme de super-herÃ³is\" todos caindo. Bem, eu perdi ainda mais da minha vida digitando sobre esse saco de esterco de vaca. EntÃ£o, apesar de tudo, nÃ£o assista a este filme, a menos que o seu QI seja inferior a 80.   \n",

Steel was one of the four possible Supermen who appeared right after Superman was killed by Doomsday in the comic book. There is no Superman, no Doomsday, almost nothing from the DC universe in the film, except the character itself.This is not a bad thing especially since the Steel comic could have been created with out having come from Superman. The plot line of where and how Steel comes to be is a close approximation of what a Superman-less origin might have been.I don't think its a movie that wants to be any more than it is which is a fun little romp in a super hero sort of way. Shaq is fine as Steel which he plays to the best of his ability. Allowing that the character never had much depth the central performance is everything it should be. The rest of the cast is a great deal of fun as they chew scenery and try not to take anything too seriously.So sue me I like this movie. Its a fun rainy day popcorn movie of the highest order. It had no calories and nothing in it will stick anywhere in your head.Try it. Its mindless fun.</td>\n",

The acting is sooooooooooooooooo terrible, the direction rubbish, the story just mental and the overall product so bad, its great. Its one of those films you watch while shaking your head saying \" did they just say that, do that \"? The Cloth is the type of film you put on when home with drunken mates and sit and laugh at, from start to finish.Its clear that whole scenes have gone missing by the editing, which is terrible. The film was partly funded by a born again Christian church ( check the credits) and it's clearly an exercise in trying to brainwash the dumb public into becoming Christians. Which it fails at on every level.The young lead I think may be a plank, thats been dressed in clothing and the only openly evil character is a young black male with lesbian friends who all do drugs....we getting the feel yet ?The best line in the film, which for me sums it up, is spoken by what i can only explain as the \"Q\"of the exorcism world. After deciding he wants nothing to do with \"The Cloth\", the young lead storms out, throwing his outfit and cross onto the table. \"Q\" says shocked, \"Who throws Jesus onto a table like that \" ???Classic Turkey.</td>\n",

I realized that the ending just fit the overall atmosphere of the story. There is SO much that is left unsaid and it dawned on me that it is by design. That was the whole point. We simply don't know for sure and probably never will, unless there is a sequel. I've decided I'm okay with this and it's made me apreciate the movie in a whole new way.I have my own theory as to what happened. If you pay attention, there are quite a few clues throughout the movie that point to a very likely conclusion. I hate that I will never be certain, but there are a million other movies I can watch if I crave that kind of closure. This is clearly not one of those movies. It made me think outside the cookie cutter thriller/horror box. It made me question my expectations. It made me realize that the reason we get upset by these frustrating, anti-climatic endings is because of our innate need to control and correct imbalance and injustice. Sometimes life is just unfair, bad things happen and we'll never know why. Give it a chance. The movie is decent. Not a masterpiece by any stretch, but well worth a watch.</td>\n",

There were both good things and bad things about the movie, but overall I liked it, and would pay to see it again. I think the plot was solid, and easy to follow, and never lost my interest. There were a couple of scenes that were somewhat predictable, but allowed the viewer to just enjoy the movie rather than have to analyze every little detail. The cinematography was excellent. The multiple camera angles, and the split screens with the animations were awesome. The shots from the helicopters were very cool. The editing was fabulous. The locations and scenery were better than most films. I would hate to see how much all of the permits cost to shoot on the public streets, especially the Vegas scenes! The car chase scenes actually had a reason for being there, they weren't there just for added action. I personally think the stunt driving, car chasing/racing scenes were better than a lot of blockbuster movies such as the remake of \"Gone in Sixty Seconds\" or either \"Fast and the Furious\" movies. For the most part the acting was excellent. I thought the lead male role (the soldier) could have been better cast. While his fight scenes were very well choreographed and believable to watch, he didn't look comfortable in the speaking parts. All the other casting and acting was great. Eddie Griffin supplied the perfect amount of humor to keep the audience entertained. The women, OH MY GOD, all of them, in every shot! Speechless! If I had seen this movie with my girlfriend, I would have been in trouble for having my tongue hang out of my mouth for an hour and a half! I have never seen so many beautiful women in one movie! Or so many beautiful cars! The balance between awesome cars and awesome women was unbelievable. For an independent film I would give this an A+.

Yes, parts of it that I'm sure were meant to be serious were so absurd to be laughable, but when a movie has the dialogue and antics generally geared to make you laugh, how else can you take the over-the-top serious stuff? (Also, many people were saying it was too close to Dabangg. Not having seen Dabangg, I can't be a fair judge of that.) Yes, it's true, this film has no great substance to it, no overwhelmingly great message, but he bhagavan is it entertaining! I took four friends with me to the theater who had NEVER seen a Hindi film before, and most of the inside jokes and nuances of puns were lost on them, but they all thoroughly enjoyed it anyway. It was that universal.The movie was full of more crude humor than I've ever seen a Hindi film have. There was peeing (intermission is referred to as \"Pee Break\" while Salman urinates on a haystack), farting and lots of bad things happening to butts (sitting on hot pots, getting a fork stuck in a cheek, etc.). Now that may not be your cup of tea, but there's plenty of other humor to go around -- witty dialogue, absurdness, those deft inside filmy jokes, lots of innuendo (see below) -- there was a dash of every kind of humor.I've heard Ready pegged as masala, which I'll take. It's a dash of romance, a dash of (sometimes painful) action, a little family drama and a whole lot of comedy. On top of that, it has a plot! One that gets crazy and out of control, of course, but it does have a definite and distinct plot.The other thing I've seen Ready called though is a family film, which I will NOT agree with. There was more innuendo (some of it RIDICULOUSLY blatant) than I've ever seen in a Hindi film.

The story of Rogers and Clarke, two would-be songwriters a la Simon and Garfunkel is genuinely funny and worth repeated viewings just to catch all the gags and the intentionally awful lyrics. Paul Williams wrote the songs with the help of director Elaine May and they provide hilarity throughout the film.According to Leonard Maltin, the movie is structured like a Hope-Crosby outing with \"shades of 'Road to Morocco'.\" I have never seen a film in the 'Road to...' series so I have to take Maltin's word for it.Beatty and Hoffman play songwriters who meet one day and find they have the same dream. They both have tunes in their heads that distract them from their lives, their girlfriends and their jobs to such a degree that they pursue a songwriting career together. The trouble is that their songs are so bad, the lyrics so painful, that their agent (the late Jack Weston) can only get them booked in Morocco, bordering the fictional country of Ishtar.The story opens with a sampling of songs written by Lyle Rogers (Beatty) and Chuck Clarke (Hoffman). They range from the hysterical (\"She said, 'Come look, there's a wardrobe of love in my eyes/Take your time, look around, maybe see something your size.\") to the insane (\"If you admit that you can play the accordion/No one will hire you in a rock and roll band.\"). In flashbacks we see how they meet and the events leading up to their professional partnership. It must have been May who, in an inspired move, cast Hoffman as the ladies' man and Beatty as the dense Southern hick. That Hollywood joke will last long after they're gone.Once in Morocco, they unwittingly become pawns in an overthrow of Ishtar; Lyle for, Chuck against. Or is it the other way around?

While of course dear Roger Moore was really incomparable as Simon Templar, though more so in the first two seasons than later where he sadly more abandoned the character's really fine ethos for the world's corruption, Rayner's version is far better than his detractors give him credit for and I suspect this is at least part of Moore being involved in it, though not as much as I wish he'd been. Sadly we'll not likely see Rayner again, much as I wish we could. I was too shocked to find who Ogilvy was, not prepared for the aging, a sign of my own inability to deal with reality! I do wish they'd not altered Patricia's marital status from the original, but was glad they vastly improved on and avoided the perverse nature of the relationship in the 1997 version. Ogilvy was good and I really liked and watched all his episodes, but to me Rayner has the edge on him in terms of finesse and flair. Those who didn't watch this all the way through by definition literally don't know what they're talking about so you shouldn't let them decide for you. If only someone had enough sense to give Rayner another shot at this; of course I won't hold my breath for that considering how badly they ruined the last Star Wars, as well as the laughable PC misandry of the latest Dr. Who!</td>\n",

However, since I haven't seen the original Stepfather film I can't compare them both, but what I have seen in this remake is something else. I was really, really impressed with this, and I am going to have to seek out the original now to see what it was like.The Stepfather basically tells the story of \"David\" - a disturbed man who is apparently normal and caring on the outside but very unstable on the inside, both psychologically and emotionally and one of who lives a lot double lives, looking for recently divorced women to emotionally manipulate them and ultimately, breaks them down and kills them and any immediate family. I always compare him to the girl out of the Orphan because they both have nearly the same tactics at luring people into trusting them - in fact this movie reminded me of Orphan a lot. Anyway, when he senses he may be in danger of having his history found out, \"David\" takes even more extreme action to cover his steps up a lot quicker than he would normally do. \"David\" has been doing this many for years, and also has evaded capture from the police by changing his appearance and never using any ID when purchasing, for example a car. He always pays in cash, and always changes his appearance in somewhat way before moving onto his next victim. You may think it's a relatively simple plot, but the movie itself is a lot of fun and suspense. There's also a lot of psychological tension and build up as \"David\"'s new family become suspicious of his activities and his apparent lack of background information. As the movie progresses, things turn for the worse for the family he has deceived as they become wary of his background.The acting is first class, and the guy who acts as \"David\", Dylan Walsh?

You could fast-forward through all the unpleasant scenes in your life, or freeze frame something that is happening now, or you could go back into time with your life. It all sounds good, but as our main character \"Michael Newman\" (Adam Sandler) found out, it's not so cool. That's a key message here, too, that avoiding the bad things is not necessarily what's best for us. The major message, however, was that spending time with your family is more important than putting your job ahead of them, as far as priorities go. That theme leads to some touching scenes in the final 30 minutes of this comedy. As funny as this film is, you would be hard-pressed not to have some tears in your eyes at some point near the end of this film.Sandler plays a typical role for him, and utters some great lines and uses sight gags as well for plenty of his laughs. Kate Bekinsale, who plays his wife \"Donna,\" looks absolutely beautiful, the prettiest I've seen her since \"Pearl Harbor.\" She plays a nice lady in here, too. Their little kids - especially the girl (Tatum McCann) - are cute and funny at times. I won't mention the dog. I can't without being crude. Christopher Walken is here, and that usually means good news as he tends to play fun-and-interesting characters. Unfortunately - just a warning - this comedy, as so many modern-day ones are, has its share of crude moments, some language and the above-mentioned sexual material. O...</td>\n",

Go see this movie while you can on the big screen. If you liked the first 2 movies this movie is very much more along those lines than the other sequels. Arnold being old fits great!

CGI were mostly spot- on, only one or two scenes pulled me out of immersion. As a big plus, the film took some time to actually present the world itself without jumping to action.

In most scenes she behaved exactly like her character should, it didn't feel forced or overacted to me.And for the plot itself, I'm not saying it was fresh or never seen before thing, but it was a nice take and it brought something to the franchise.

During his time filling in he has grown close to the young son of the family and promises not to let anyone hurt him. Of course the boy is kidnapped and Frank is not only a suspect, he's also the only one who can save the boy and stop the real plot which involves mass murder.The key thing to understand about this film is that it is completely fantastic and unreal. The stunts, the plot, the whole thing, is completely impossible. If you can accept that fact and just go with it the you'll have a great time. If you want reality in your movies stay home, this movie is completely unreal.The action is spectacular, and the film makers have out done themselves. Its amazing. Everything about the fights and chases is absolutely first rate.The characters are great. Frank is the same great character from the first film. We get to see him actually grow as a person. We feel for him as we see him act as the frantic surrogate father, and our heart breaks as we see somethings go wrong. Taconi, the police inspector is back, and is a joy to behold. I wish that he was better used, but just having him on screen is enough for me.The villains are monstrous people who will do anything to anyone for money or pleasure. They are truly suitable foils for our hero. They are so good, that you never know from the get go how bad things are going to get, or if Frank will actually get out of this alive.

This time the action literally starts with a bang (a big one) when Riggs (Gibson) and Murtaugh (Glover) answer a call and, suffice to say, Riggs can't wait for the bomb squad to arrive.  It makes for a spectacular opening scene, but it's just a warm up for what follows.  Some bad things are going down in the City of Angels, perhaps not unusual for L.A., but someone is putting automatic weapons and armor piercing bullets (called `Cop Killers' as they can penetrate a bullet proof vest) on the streets, which is really bad news for police officers in general, and especially for those in particular areas of the city.  Riggs and Murtaugh are on the case, but it quickly escalates, and because of certain untoward circumstances soon falls into the hands of Internal Affairs.  Which brings Officer Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) into the picture.  And sparks begin to fly. \\tThe first two installments of this series are hard to beat, but as they say, the third time's a charm; and Donner must have had the shaman working with him on this one, because he pulled off quite a feat-- making a third that ranks right up there with the first two.  He seems to have found the perfect balance with this one; the main characters are in place and established, Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) is back, and the addition of Russo is the icing on the cake.  The story is good, there's plenty of great action and some sensational stunts, and the humor has been toned down a notch, which increases the level of intensity of the drama.  In short, Donner measures out all of the right elements to perfection and makes it all gel together for the complete package.  And what a package it is. \\tBy now, Gibson IS Riggs, from the inside out; still somewhat on the edge, but not quite...</td>\n",

Seems like time flows like Narnian time here. \"Voyage of the Dawn Treader\" marks the third film in the Narnia franchise. It follows King Caspian in a journey to find the seven lost lords of Narnia whom King Miraz banished during his reign in the previous film with his ship, the Dawn Treader. On the way, he met Edmund, Lucy and their pathetic cousin, Eustace Scrubb who turned out to have a change in the movie. However, there's this horrifying green mist that can tempt you to do things that can lead up to bad things and the whereabouts of these lost lords are unknown. So, these people take on a journey that passes the beyond the Silver Sea (which must be really somewhere very east) and to the \"End of the World\".

His actions are the main source of laughs here. His acting also maximized the laughs in this film and I think comedy is what strengthens this movie. \"Voyage\" is also powerful in exciting action scenes.

It is a modern version of the book of Job, which--of course you remember--contains a prologue in which God and Satan bet on whether Job will remain faithful and Satan then strikes down Job's flocks, children, and health; a series of speeches by three comforters with Job's responses; a speech by Elihu who is unhappy with the advice of the three comforters; the Lord himself answering Job directly out of the whirlwind ('who is this who darkens counsel by words without knowledge?'); a final submissive speech by Job ('I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye see thee, wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes'); and an epilogue in which Job receives more flocks and children (...) than he had before.The book and the film address what (Christian, at least) theologians call theodicy, or how bad things can happen in the world when God, who supposedly controls everything, is supposedly good. For nonbelievers (if you have any interest in the subject), the best way to think of this is perhaps to ask yourself whether the universe (the Creation) is on balance a good thing ('and God saw that it was good'). If so, then perhaps we somehow have an obligation to live moral lives and (as Jews and Christians think of it) to follow God's law. If not, then perhaps it's every man for himself and the Devil take the hindmost.The Coens' answer, if I understand it correctly, comes out of the whirlwind at the end in the voice of Grace Slick. I personally prefer God's original response with its paean to astrophysics and evolutionary biology--'Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? ...

When the trailer for MAGIC MIKE was revealed, it was labeled as just a \"male stripper movie,\" like how BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN was just a \"gay cowboy movie.\" This generic label, undermining and downgrading the film's actual quality, even overshadows the fact that Steven Soderbergh is the director, who rarely make films that lack substance. Yes, MAGIC MIKE has style, but it has substance as well. Here's the kicker: Those who want to see the film primarily for the stripping may be left disappointed, as they will likely fidget in their seats for these scenes to come. As one lady sitting next to me said once the credits rolled, \"Worst movie ever.\" On the other hand, those who refuse to see the film because of its subject matter may be missing a great film.To state it simply, MAGIC MIKE is a BOOGIE NIGHTS-lite, which isn't a bad thing considering how utterly dark and depressing BOOGIE NIGHTS gets in its second half. The first half of MAGIC MIKE is light and breezy and quite funny. In fact, most of the jokes in here are funnier than most modern comedies try to achieve. We are introduced to this world that is fascinating because of how surprisingly mundane and economics-centered it is. The stripping sequences, filled with energy and sexiness, are mostly played for laughs. We get exposed to a lot of male asses, ripped abs, and pelvic thrusts, but it's all in good fun. Then, things slowly start to take a dark turn in the second half. It isn't hard to imagine people thinking, \"Wait. Isn't this a stripping movie?\" Characters start to make bad decisions and one thing leads to another and so on. You get the idea.The cast is terrific all around.

They put a strong emphasis on building a super creepy atmosphere rather than focus on pointless blood and gore. Because of this, you're on edge pretty much the whole time. I can't say it's the scariest thing I've ever seen, but it was certainly nerve wracking throughout. The plot of the movie revolves around a brother and sister trying to prove that this weird mirror is haunted and is responsible for many deaths over the years, including their father's death. This mirror makes you see things that aren't really happening and it screws with your perception of reality. It makes the main characters kind of lose it mentally. The film loses structure and coherency as the the character's minds deteriorate, and that isn't a bad thing at all. It adds to the movie really. I thought the correlation between their state of mind and the film's structure was pretty cool. Also, the child actors in this movie are fantastic. They were never annoying and the way they acted like normal children (for the most part). That being said, it isn't flawless. You could watch this and completely hate it. I could definitely see the overall confusing narrative turning people away. It's a fairly subjective movie I think. You could love it or hate it.

Being a huge Meryl Streep fan (Chief Elder), I was very excited to see her performance and, I was not disappointed. Jeff Bridges' (The Giver) performance gives this film a veteran presence that adds to the wisdom their characters possess. As for Brenton Thwaites (Jonas) and Odeya Rush (Fiona), their performances show great promise for their careers. Their youth and lack of experience add a sense of naÃ¯vetÃ© to their characters that beautifully contradicts with the characters played by both Streep and Bridges. I find the script a bit pretentious but necessarily so. The premise itself is very complex but suitable for the subject matter. What could have 90 minutes of melodrama turns into brilliant and intelligent conversations thanks to the skills of the ensemble. I give an Oscar nod for both Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges.There is a scene towards the end of the film where The Giver and Chief Elder debate on the pros and cons of memories and allowing people to make decisions. That is one of the very best acted scenes I've seen this year. The dialogue is so poetic that we're drawn into the fantasy instead of repulsed by its theatrical nature.My favorite part of the film, second to Meryl's performance, is the beautiful cinematography by Ross Emery. Mr. Emery and Editor Barry Alexander Brown really come together wonderfully to create awesome moments of visual storytelling. The mixture of black and white with color, and the short shots of real life events give this film a certain vivacity the book is unable to give.This film is really quite an achievement.

Eddie Murphy is back, as well as Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, and Ronny Cox. In addition to them, some new characters are introduced such as Brigitte Nielsen &amp; Jurgen Prochnow as the new villains, and the cute Alice Adair as Ronny Cox's daughter in the film.Another reason why this sequel is good is because of the way the action and comedy scenes are balanced. While not as funny as the first film, Beverly Hills Cop 2 has a nice balanced blend of action and comedy. This means that both action &amp; comedy fans will love this movie.Here is the final reason that this sequel is good: So many great cameos are featured in the film! There are cameos by Paul Reiser (again), Gilbert Gottfried, Chris Rock, Hugh Hefner, Carrie Leigh, and DOZENS of sexy Playboy Playmates! Perhaps the only bad thing about the film is that there were many noticeable mistakes in editing. However, upon watching this movie more than 5 times, I got over the mistakes and managed to look past them. The good things about this movie far outweigh its disadvantages.To sum up, I strongly recommend this film to those who loved the first movie.

In most movies you see the main characters sleep together within a day at the most, which rarely happens with two people who are really in love. True love has to take time and effort, which is exactly what you see here. Travolta's George is patient, but not because he wants to be. If you're a romantic at heart you will understand and relate to him, and you will hope for his success as you would for your own. Without giving anything away, I will tell you that the ending is sad, but also heartwarming. George has his \"experience\" for no other reason than to suggest what we as humans can become.

Rather the focus is on the action sequences and clever humor. This is not necessarily a bad thing though; in fact it helps move the plot along. The first film suffered because the story was slow. In this Holmes though, there is not one second that drags. The story itself is not special, but its pace is what counts. Walking out of the theater, I felt refreshed and glad that I saw this movie. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are once again a true treat to watch as Holmes and Watson. Their chemistry and interactions are perfect; it's easy to tell that both had fun with the script and with each other. Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty gives a solid performance, as a cold, manipulative, power hungry villain. Unlike Mark Strong in the first film, he is a believable antagonist. Noomi Rapace is a nice flavor as Madam Sim. The set and costume designs are exquisite, bringing to life of what Europe was like in the late 1800s. I smell Oscar for these departments. The sound and editing is crisply done, and the music is top-notchedâHans, you're truly the best.

Baymax is a big lovable idiot-type robot who was built to provide healthcare for humans. Hiro sees Baymax as a chance to get revenge on his brother's killer and with him and his new- found friends they embark on a journey to get justice.Some of the film's best scenes come from Hiro's attempts to turn Baymax into a badass fighting machine. This results in hilarious moments because we still have our big lovable idiot.. but now he has awesome superpowers, and i must say this kept me thoroughly entertained. The other characters were also awesome and each had their own personality traits but at the end we are left with the relationship between Hiro and Baymax, although definitely not a bad thing because as an audience we can never have enough Baymax.I did feel that this film suffered from what Guardians of the Galaxy also suffered with which is that the villain was underdeveloped, although unlike Ronan the villain in this film (no spoilers) did have a fleshed out plan and was quite a surprise twist. In the end I came out of Big Hero 6 feeling satisfied and entertained, featuring the humour of Marvel and the heart of Disney, this one is well worth a watch for people of all ages and if you don't want your own personal Baymax by the end then something must be wrong with you!</td>\n",

       "      <td>First for newbies, the events here took place prior to the Kevin Spacey film Margin Call (2011). So the Spacey film would have depicted events near the end of this film. Both are superb movies.Back to the review. This film is very unusual in that the producers have shown fierce determination in taking a serious topic and making it as user friendly as one possibly can. Multiple techniques are used to this end and they all work well. In fact in places the film has a Monty Python quality. Why was this done? One can only assume that the producers understood the multiple studies showing that the modern city-dweller becomes uncomfortable when confronted with any facts which suggest that he or she was not paying attention when bad things were happening. After all we live in a democracy so the voters should have been more alert? Isn't that their job? The techniques mentioned attempt to appeal to our SESAME STREET side and make the whole thing as pleasant an educational experience as possible. But make no mistake, this is an educational movie.One that should be mandatory for adults. Like getting a driving test before a license. How about learning about Wall Street and the banks before you invest with them...? Carell steals the film and may finally get the attention he deserves. Great actor.Finally the message. The film suggests not only that Wall Street is corrupt but that the corruption extends to the agencies mandated to supervise Wall Street and (possibly) to Washington itself. The implicit message, conveyed in the end credits, that unless we deal with the problem at the source the symptoms will keep happening over and over and over.Duh!</td>\n",

       "      <td>This was a great movie. Cage delivered on the \"anti-hero\" - a 21st century \"Corleone\". The locations were cool and \"spectacular\". From a visual standpoint this movie really does take you around the world. New York, Russia, Libya, Libera, etc. This movie is shot very, very well.The pacing of the movie is brisk, the scenes aren't morose. Like Platoon, this movie doesn't glamorize or demonize situations. A guy who sells weapons for a living meets some violent people in some violent places. The visual style is breathtaking . . . What I like best is, no characters in the movie are \"romanticized\". There are no \"good guys\". One could make the case that there are no \"bad guys\" as well I suppose. There are people who do bad things for reasons you don't understand. There are people who do nothing when they should do something for reasons you don't understand. Its a pretty accurate depiction of real life :)I think I might have rated the movie 8.5, if there were any other movies at all about this topic that were anywhere in its league. If you make a great \"Legally Blond\", that's nice. If you make a great movie about arms trading with a sold antihero and supporting characters, I figure you get \"extra credit\".I think you're a fool if you miss this movie. Its not about Iraq. Its not particularly political. This movie could have been made under any president in the last 100 years and been just as accurate. Its not particularly anti-gun. Its just about this guy who sells guns. On the other hand, don't take people to this movie if they can't handle violence or movies that aren't designed to make them \"feel good\" when they walk out. This is a good movie, its interesting, its intelligent, its important -- but its not Ferris Buellers Day Off or Spinal Tap.</td>\n",

But I guess if they weren't, then the film would be a fair bit shorter.I can't think of any other bad things about it, as it does what it is supposed to do, make you care about the characters and keep you gripped till the end.

       "      <td>I saw it at a German press screening. Without giving too much away: Most critics really seemed to like it very much. There was even applause afterwards, which is quite unusual for that species. From my point of view and until now, it was the funniest movie of the year. It keeps the charm and wit of the three W+G shorts and it is enlarged with many references to these and other movies. Of course, there are obvious allusions to monster- and werewolf-movies, especially to \"An American Werewolf in London\", \"Jaws\", \"King Kong\" and even to Peter Jackson's \"Braindead\"/\"Dead Alive\", but also to other genres.Characterization was better done in \"Chicken Run\", but that movie had a complete new \"cast\" where introduction was necessary. Here, you are already able to know the two main characters. So, the new \"Wallace and Gromit\"-movie is enjoyed best if you watched (and liked) the shorts already, yet it also works on its own. \"Chicken Run\" had the more convenient, but also more \"storytelling\" plot. Instead, this new Aardman masterpiece keeps that crazier and somehow more \"isolated\" feeling of the W+G shorts. Children should also enjoy it very much, especially because of the sweet rabbits (if you love cute bunnies, this is a must-see for you!!!) and because Gromit has a lot do to and really steals the show (children also love dogs... :-) ). But many jokes are thought for a more adult audience (there are even soft sexual allusions in it). The movie manages, like \"Shrek 1+2\" and \"The Incredibles\", to fulfil high level entertainment for the whole family, with adding a British and at least a little bit darker edge to the humour of American animated movies.The animation is Â as expected Â superb, and they kept true to the Aardman style because they didn't put in too many digital effects - I realized just a few when it came to Wallace's inventions.Finally, the score works fine in the movie, although one of the main themes definitely is \"borrowed\" by Randy Edelman's \"Dragonheart\" sc...</td>\n",

If you've never seen a Miyazaki film before, then it will probably confuse the heck out of you. If you have seen a Miyazaki film before, then it will still probably confuse the heck out of you....but you won't really care! That's because I found that the first time I saw one of his animated films, I tried too hard to figure out what was happening and why--and it impacted my enjoyment of the film. Now that I have seen just about every Miyazaki film, I see the bizarreness and just take it all in--enjoying the beauty of it all. In many ways, these films (at least to Western audiences) is like drugs--lots of strange and beautiful images that don't always initially make sense but sure feel great to see!! Of all the Miyazaki films, this might have the most unusual and incomprehensible story line--even more so than SPIRITED AWAY and PRINCESS MONONOKE or MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO. But, like these and many other Studio Gibli films, if you just sit back and watch you are rewarded with a fabulous tale. But, because it is so hard to describe (and others have already done so), I won't even go there.As for the artwork, it's very typical of one of these Japanese films, though there was one noticeable change. There was a very extensive use of what looked like colored pencils for the backgrounds. This was NOT a bad thing at all--the lovely pastel-like look was very pleasing and unique. In some ways it looked like a tiny bit of Bill Plympton's art style was infused into a typical Miyazaki film. With a high frame-rate, exceptional character animation (which imbued them with tons of personality) and a great \"wow-factor\", this is an exceptional film for all ages. Though clearly designed more for younger audiences (the TOTORO fans especially), it is a bit scary here and there (during the storm segments) but there is plenty of great stuff for adults.

       "      <td>Alfonso Cuaron's Y Tu Mama Bien is one of the better films of the year (not quite best, but still highly recommendable). Cuaron, who scripted with his brother Carlos, tells a story with such a level of stark and touching realism that the audience will not only feel for the three main characters, but will feel like their along the ride with them. In this story, Tenoch and Julio are two friends whose girlfriends go away to Italy for a little while and are left with not much to do (outside of partying and masturbation) until they get an idea to go to a secluded beach called Heaven's Mouth and ask the married and 10 years older Luisa to come along. She agrees after discovering her husband cheated on her more than she could stand and this takes the movie onto a road trip with dialog and actions that, despite having the be read on the bottom of the screen in subtitle format, is much better than most teen movies that go for sex related dialog (however, Cuaron had to go back to Mexico to make this type of movie so that the MPAA wouldn't s*** on it and make him re-edit it to a NC-17) and action. The only flaws keeping Cuaron's latest work from being a great coming of age tale is that the narration, while keeping in some good insight along the way, becomes heavy handed at times and gives information that is either humorist news along the area the characters are traveling or about the characters themselves which isn't a bad thing until it digs into things that don't have much relevance to the rest of the picture or even to the characters when you think about what is really up on the screen. Plus, the very last scene is too conventional to be placed as where the film leads up to (he should've ended it when Luisa goes into the ocean the last time).But still, these squabbles shouldn't stop people from seeing this movie, overall it delivers splendidly in it's uninhibited and mature ways. Props also go to the performances by the three leads and to the cinematography.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Though this film fits the coming of age genre the struggles that Nadine, the main character, is going through are not purely 'teen problems', As a 20 something year old this film deeply resonated with me and though similar to Nadine I was a socially awkward, defensive and pessimistic teenager it wasn't just the teenage me who could find the character relatable. I've noticed in the low rated comments one of the main reasons people didn't like the film is because the main character isn't likeable. And though I loved the film, I would agree; she isn't likeable. And the film is more realistic and better off for it. In real life we aren't always likeable people ourselves and the film almost acts as a tool to allow us to step back and really look at our current or teenage selves. Nadine does realise and understand towards the end and throughout the film her erratic and selfish behaviour is a result of her self loathing because she knows she doesn't want to continue being that way but she's stuck in this endless cycle and doesn't know how to get out. The valuable lesson from the film and her journey within it is that we often bring misfortune and unhappiness on ourselves in the way we handle and respond to bad things in our lives. I think this film will speak to anyone who has felt alone in the world, lost without purpose or anywhere to fit in. If you like films about people rather than action and you watch a film to be taken on a journey (albeit an emotional one) rather than to have an enjoyable couple of hours then this may be the film for you. It helps that is has an excellent cast, each actor fitting their roles well and bringing them to life.Another positive note I took away from the film is the way it handles and represents mental illness/ distress as it does so without labels and in a subtle way without needing to bring it to the forefront.</td>\n",

The film consists of an all-star cast, including the likes of the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney. Even Michael Shannon shares a brief, but memorable, bit of run time. The casting was excellent all around and there were no characters that felt out of place or unnecessary to the story. Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke specifically were the best either of them have ever been. The solid script and carefully written dialogue shared between the two main characters delivers some of the film's most riveting moments. And the \"car scene\" is one of Hoffman's most memorable on-screen moments. Those of you who have seen the film will know what I am referring to and those unaware are in for a treat.The story, while simple and admittedly not too original, manages to effectively show the characters' descent into violence and madness while jumping to before and after the event in which the movie revolves around. While sometimes the movie holds our hand a little too much with the story telling, I appreciated the fact that this movie wanted us to never be confused or lost within the time-jumping narrative. I was always aware of where our characters were and what point of the story I was witnessing.Now I have seen many comparisons between this film and the masterpiece known as Fargo, and while it shares the same theme of \"simple crime gone horribly wrong\" Before The Devil Knows You're Dead is not a darkly comedic venture. In fact, this movie is rarely anything but somber and hopeless. This is not a bad thing though as it seems that this was the director's intent.

There is no Superman, no Doomsday, almost nothing from the DC universe in the film, except the character itself.This is not a bad thing especially since the Steel comic could have been created with out having come from Superman. The plot line of where and how Steel comes to be is a close approximation of what a Superman-less origin might have been.I don't think its a movie that wants to be any more than it is which is a fun little romp in a super hero sort of way. Shaq is fine as Steel which he plays to the best of his ability. Allowing that the character never had much depth the central performance is everything it should be. The rest of the cast is a great deal of fun as they chew scenery and try not to take anything too seriously.So sue me I like this movie. Its a fun rainy day popcorn movie of the highest order. It had no calories and nothing in it will stick anywhere in your head.Try it. Its mindless fun.   \n",

The acting is sooooooooooooooooo terrible, the direction rubbish, the story just mental and the overall product so bad, its great. Its one of those films you watch while shaking your head saying \" did they just say that, do that \"? The Cloth is the type of film you put on when home with drunken mates and sit and laugh at, from start to finish.Its clear that whole scenes have gone missing by the editing, which is terrible. The film was partly funded by a born again Christian church ( check the credits) and it's clearly an exercise in trying to brainwash the dumb public into becoming Christians. Which it fails at on every level.The young lead I think may be a plank, thats been dressed in clothing and the only openly evil character is a young black male with lesbian friends who all do drugs....we getting the feel yet ?The best line in the film, which for me sums it up, is spoken by what i can only explain as the \"Q\"of the exorcism world. After deciding he wants nothing to do with \"The Cloth\", the young lead storms out, throwing his outfit and cross onto the table. \"Q\" says shocked, \"Who throws Jesus onto a table like that \" ???Classic Turkey.   \n",

Then I slept on it and woke up still thinking about this movie. I realized that the ending just fit the overall atmosphere of the story. There is SO much that is left unsaid and it dawned on me that it is by design. That was the whole point. We simply don't know for sure and probably never will, unless there is a sequel. I've decided I'm okay with this and it's made me apreciate the movie in a whole new way.I have my own theory as to what happened. If you pay attention, there are quite a few clues throughout the movie that point to a very likely conclusion. I hate that I will never be certain, but there are a million other movies I can watch if I crave that kind of closure. This is clearly not one of those movies. It made me think outside the cookie cutter thriller/horror box. It made me question my expectations. It made me realize that the reason we get upset by these frustrating, anti-climatic endings is because of our innate need to control and correct imbalance and injustice. Sometimes life is just unfair, bad things happen and we'll never know why. Give it a chance. The movie is decent. Not a masterpiece by any stretch, but well worth a watch.   \n",
       "120638  Let me be the first to say that my knowledge of movie making is very limited, but I do know what I like. I thought the movie was good. There were both good things and bad things about the movie, but overall I liked it, and would pay to see it again. I think the plot was solid, and easy to follow, and never lost my interest. There were a couple of scenes that were somewhat predictable, but allowed the viewer to just enjoy the movie rather than have to analyze every little detail. The cinematography was excellent. The multiple camera angles, and the split screens with the animations were awesome. The shots from the helicopters were very cool. The editing was fabulous. The locations and scenery were better than most films. I would hate to see how much all of the permits cost to shoot on the public streets, especially the Vegas scenes! The car chase scenes actually had a reason for being there, they weren't there just for added action. I personally think the stunt driving, car chasing/racing scenes were better than a lot of blockbuster movies such as the remake of \"Gone in Sixty Seconds\" or either \"Fast and the Furious\" movies. For the most part the acting was excellent. I thought the lead male role (the soldier) could have been better cast. While his fight scenes were very well choreographed and believable to watch, he didn't look comfortable in the speaking parts. All the other casting and acting was great. Eddie Griffin supplied the perfect amount of humor to keep the audience entertained. The women, OH MY GOD, all of them, in every shot! Speechless! If I had seen this movie with my girlfriend, I would have been in trouble for having my tongue hang out of my mouth for an hour and a half! I have never seen so many beautiful women in one movie! Or so many beautiful cars! The balance between awesome cars and awesome women was unbelievable. For an independent film I would give this an A+. This was by far the most entertaining, edge of your seat, car racing film I hav...   \n",

We just returned from Sundance and I saw it with a crew of girlfriends whom I've know for 25 years. I would say the chicks will like it more than the guys since just about every bad thing that could happen to a girl happened to Rebecca (McCarthy) in this movie. I would love to know what others think.Jenny McCarthy did some great acting. I could feel her pain. I loved the music and plot of this movieWe stayed for the Q&A after the premiere and Jenny McCarthy and John Asher seemed genuinely thrilled and over the moon about the audience reaction. They were stoked and I could tell they were proud of their work.The performances by Eddie Kaye Thomas, Carmen Electra and Kam were fantastic.   \n",

I never seen something so sick. this movie I don't know is a comedy is it action mystery whatever it works. It has it all women,guns, scorpians drugs. it wasn't to long because i get pretty bored some times and i was really bored but damn i really liked the oldest actor loggia man he hasn't had a role this good since frank in scarface he is crazy man. actually i forgot about independence day he was pretty good in that, but this is by far his best stuff, I would compare this movie with like say pulpfiction or very bad things or lost boys with a dash of stand by me. i want to see his other movie now.   \n",

Relying less on \"Jump Scares\" it packs a more psychological punch.5 people wake up in the middle of nowhere realizing that they are unable leave - and that this is all some sort of punishment for the lives they have lead. At first it seems like not much of a punishment- but when 5 \"bad\" people are trapped together BAD things start to happen. The cast is talented, pretty and fun to look at, but it is the ugliness of their actions that keeps you watching.I found myself still thinking about some of the questions brought up in the film, days after.   \n",

I get so sick of people harping on remakes and new additions as if the new movie takes anything away from the old movie. That's absolutely ridiculous. Even if the remake/addition is terrible they are completely separate movies. They may share a title and some common characters but that is it. The original will still be the same regardless of what comes after it.Either way, this movie is fantastic. I went in with high expectations because I was thrilled that the franchise wasn't dead and it didn't disappoint. A brand new spin on things with all the gore you could ask for. Anyone who says this movie is no good is either too dumb to understand why it played out as it did or still suckling on the teet of the theory that the remakes/sequels should follow the exact same path that a completely different director/set of writers/cast/etc. took almost 40 years ago. There is no bigger fan/critic of TCM movies and I loved this movie. The only reason it didn't get 10 out of 10 from me is because of the short length. But maybe I'm just upset that I didn't get to watch Heather for longer...lol GD movie communists.   \n",

They had the best lines, the best attitudes etc. Jada Pinkett playing a lesbian was really funny, she really played it well and was very convincing. The only bad thing about the film was the fact that the other two main characters weren't as funny even though the movie focused around them........

       "121489  I laughed HYSTERICALLY throughout the entire movie! It was that fantastic! Yes, parts of it that I'm sure were meant to be serious were so absurd to be laughable, but when a movie has the dialogue and antics generally geared to make you laugh, how else can you take the over-the-top serious stuff? (Also, many people were saying it was too close to Dabangg. Not having seen Dabangg, I can't be a fair judge of that.) Yes, it's true, this film has no great substance to it, no overwhelmingly great message, but he bhagavan is it entertaining! I took four friends with me to the theater who had NEVER seen a Hindi film before, and most of the inside jokes and nuances of puns were lost on them, but they all thoroughly enjoyed it anyway. It was that universal.The movie was full of more crude humor than I've ever seen a Hindi film have. There was peeing (intermission is referred to as \"Pee Break\" while Salman urinates on a haystack), farting and lots of bad things happening to butts (sitting on hot pots, getting a fork stuck in a cheek, etc.). Now that may not be your cup of tea, but there's plenty of other humor to go around -- witty dialogue, absurdness, those deft inside filmy jokes, lots of innuendo (see below) -- there was a dash of every kind of humor.I've heard Ready pegged as masala, which I'll take. It's a dash of romance, a dash of (sometimes painful) action, a little family drama and a whole lot of comedy. On top of that, it has a plot! One that gets crazy and out of control, of course, but it does have a definite and distinct plot.The other thing I've seen Ready called though is a family film, which I will NOT agree with. There was more innuendo (some of it RIDICULOUSLY blatant) than I've ever seen in a Hindi film. For a genre that manages to skirt the sex issue even when hookers are around, this one really lays the references on thick.Sallu sometimes has the tendency to get on my nerves with his attitude. Yes, there are moments when Salman's attitude made me rol...   \n",
       "121613  Despite what was spent on this film and the awful reviews that followed (the latter based solely on the former), I really enjoyed this movie. The story of Rogers and Clarke, two would-be songwriters a la Simon and Garfunkel is genuinely funny and worth repeated viewings just to catch all the gags and the intentionally awful lyrics. Paul Williams wrote the songs with the help of director Elaine May and they provide hilarity throughout the film.According to Leonard Maltin, the movie is structured like a Hope-Crosby outing with \"shades of 'Road to Morocco'.\" I have never seen a film in the 'Road to...' series so I have to take Maltin's word for it.Beatty and Hoffman play songwriters who meet one day and find they have the same dream. They both have tunes in their heads that distract them from their lives, their girlfriends and their jobs to such a degree that they pursue a songwriting career together. The trouble is that their songs are so bad, the lyrics so painful, that their agent (the late Jack Weston) can only get them booked in Morocco, bordering the fictional country of Ishtar.The story opens with a sampling of songs written by Lyle Rogers (Beatty) and Chuck Clarke (Hoffman). They range from the hysterical (\"She said, 'Come look, there's a wardrobe of love in my eyes/Take your time, look around, maybe see something your size.\") to the insane (\"If you admit that you can play the accordion/No one will hire you in a rock and roll band.\"). In flashbacks we see how they meet and the events leading up to their professional partnership. It must have been May who, in an inspired move, cast Hoffman as the ladies' man and Beatty as the dense Southern hick. That Hollywood joke will last long after they're gone.Once in Morocco, they unwittingly become pawns in an overthrow of Ishtar; Lyle for, Chuck against. Or is it the other way around?

Reality is there, you can see it clear as day, but the story is all about her innocent nature. The bad things are presented, but not dwelled upon. You get to know her and by the end you just wish to get to know her more, that's how sweet she is.The camera moves are well chosen, the point of views and focus done just right. The scoring is just as sweet as the main actress and all the characters are well played. The scenario is a great balance in time and subjects, presenting you a lot of tidbits, in a concise manner that you can easily ingest.It's almost perfect. The only reproach I can make is that it is so sweet, it has no punch. I must admit, I didn't care that it didn't. I will watch it again many times, that is a guaranty.Easily listening. I highly recommend it to the naughty one waiting for a candy inside of you.   \n",

While of course dear Roger Moore was really incomparable as Simon Templar, though more so in the first two seasons than later where he sadly more abandoned the character's really fine ethos for the world's corruption, Rayner's version is far better than his detractors give him credit for and I suspect this is at least part of Moore being involved in it, though not as much as I wish he'd been. Sadly we'll not likely see Rayner again, much as I wish we could. I was too shocked to find who Ogilvy was, not prepared for the aging, a sign of my own inability to deal with reality! I do wish they'd not altered Patricia's marital status from the original, but was glad they vastly improved on and avoided the perverse nature of the relationship in the 1997 version. Ogilvy was good and I really liked and watched all his episodes, but to me Rayner has the edge on him in terms of finesse and flair. Those who didn't watch this all the way through by definition literally don't know what they're talking about so you shouldn't let them decide for you. If only someone had enough sense to give Rayner another shot at this; of course I won't hold my breath for that considering how badly they ruined the last Star Wars, as well as the laughable PC misandry of the latest Dr. Who!   \n",

Usually it's the Cia or the Military. This time he wants to quit being a thief. But on the first day of his new job as a driver for money a diamonds it seems that he is being set up. Well.. so he tries to split, destroying a lot of cop cars during that attempt. Well then he leaves the car with 20 Million $ somewhere and gets picked up by the police. Suddenly he finds himself in Jail. (Without a trial I mind you). In the Penetentiary he makes a fried who helps him escape. And further a bad thing for him: He kinda forgot where he stashed the money. And the guy he is now after is kinda involved in the setup but he needs the money also. And of course nobody knows if the the Guy, called Max by the way, is still alive or not. (I becomes clear later on but I don't want to spoil it for you). Well and then there is his girlfriend having visions. Why and what for.. nobody knows... Oh and there is a lot of stuntman replacement for Seagal even when it's not necessary. BUT: Compared to his last movies like Submerged, Into the sun and other, well not so really good movies this one is a real masterpiece. So I rated it with 9. But that's on a Seagal Scale... On a regular Scale it would be 3 or 4.. Oh and for the Actionfans: there is a lot of it and really bloody.. so if that's what you are looking for you are gonna get it... regards, Stephan   \n",
       "122213  I had quite an outstanding and unique experience watching this film, something happened that I've never experienced before in a movie theatre:Objectively, this movie is bad. The script is incredibly weak, the plot is full of clichÃ©s and can be summed up in several sentences, character development (if existent) is totally predictable and one-dimensional, and the characters are all genuine stereotypes - there are absolutely no \"normal\" people in this movie, every single person/robot that inhabits the world is a silly caricature of some kind. The number of bad things in this movie is beyond measure................except that I didn't notice a single one at all (!!!!) until later, when my friend and I went to grab a beer and pondered about the film a little... Yup....that's it. When you make yourself comfortable in your cinema chair, the lights go out and this whirlwind of a movie starts, it's something entirely different. Slowly, all of my senses became overwhelmed in a manner that my brain obviously decided to completely ignore every single thing that I look for in a (good) film in favor of pure fun. With my higher functions disabled like that, I just stared at the screen with my eyes almost out of their sockets and my lower jaw on the floor, and absolutely didn't notice the stupidity of some characters, plot holes and clichÃ©s, just incredibly enjoying this outstanding feast for my senses. Incredible, just incredible...With all the advancements in CGI, sound editing and cinema technology overall, I believe this film is (sadly or not?)the prototype for the future of cinema entertainment, where all the things that should make a good quality movie (like intellectual weight) will be dropped in favor of stimulating your most primitive senses to the n-th degree and pure entertainment value that goes straight up through the roof, a concept which is slowly developing in an art form of its own. Because of that, this is (all its numerous and gigantic flaws if you judge it...   \n",

The first two each only had one really good scene in it, so I figured it would be the same for this one. Plus it being another sequel, I didn't have all that high of hopes, but I ended up being really surprised. I thought they did a great job with the movie. The acting wasn't that bad and the death scenes weren't bad either. There were only a few things that were unrealistic (a digital camera making a flash sound like an old fashioned camera would have?) but those were only in the very beginning of the movie. I honestly think this was a better overall movie than one or two. It really is suspenseful from start to finish, so much so that I think I left the theater with a stomach ache I had so much anxiety over the movie, it really messes with your head. Give it a chance, you'll be surprised at how good it is!   \n",

Big mistake, this is a funny wonderful comedy. I guess some people think Adam Sandler movies are good. I don't get it. OK the structure was a little worn out, I felt like it was following a well worn path, but the it made me laugh and I enjoyed the ride. As usual Steve Carrell was great as a narcissistic D-list celebrity starring in a cheesy Las Vegas act. I lived in Vegas for 25 years and I can tell you that entertainers like him hang on to the same tired act way to long. (I'm talking about you Wayne Newton) When he tries to spruce up the act, well its hard to teach an old dog new tricks. As always Steve Buscemi supports the star with a weird characterization. I'd heard that Jim Carey was hardly in the movie. Missed the point. Carey played an offer the top magician who injures his body and thinks its magic. Yes it entertains but how long can he go on? I thought he was hysterical, reminded me of the fire chief he played on In Living Color.Gotta mention Olivia Wilde. Can't get enough of her. Looks and her presence drew my attention to her in every scene she was in. I think I would watch her read the phone book.Critics said this was a drama masquerading as a comedy. So many bad movies pull this trick. It killed the box office. It was a shame, this movie was pure fun. Its not too late pay per view it.   \n",

My favorite part was when Honey's friend snatched out Trina's hair at the beginning of the movie. Now that was funny! Honey is just a typical girl in the music world that wants to make it in the future as a video girl. Not just any video girl, but a dancer. There were many obstacles that approached her, but she don't let it hinder her from making it. She takes it as a lesson learned. She later becomes a choreographer and makes it big. People like Missy Elliott wanted her to organize dance routines for her. Her own mother does not like what she does. But she does her thing for the children in her community, so that they would not grow up, waking up, looking forward for the bad things in life. She is a life saver to some, like Lil' Romeo and his little brother. Through it all, she becomes successful no matter was brought in her way. She became her own woman.   \n",

While engaged in deep thought, he is interrupted by a beautiful fair haired stranger. She is a woman with problems and she needs an agile, cunning, quick witted ninja to help her. Seizing the opportunity, Chris offers his services to her and thus, the adventure begins. This movie is standard Farley, humour which is buffoonish and anarchic - but that isn't a bad thing as far as I'm concerned. The best part of the film is when the aforementioned woman asks who the character who Chris plays is, and he wastes no time in telling her that he is the \"Great White Ninja\" that was foretold about in the ancient prophecies. Handily enough, the one copy of these precious words exist in scroll form, and are located nearby. Chris shows her the scroll, trying to unscroll it to the part where he is mentioned. The problem is, he is holding the ancient and valuable manuscript over a misplaced candle, and the priceless scroll is set alight. Farley reacts by throwing a bucket of water over it and ruining it forever! As if he wasn't in enough trouble already! Anyway, go and see the movie - You'll understand!   \n",
       "123329  Having not seen the original version of The Stepfather I have to say that normally I'm not a fan of remakes, and usually, yes, I do loathe them because they always tend to be a load of crap (Texas Chainsaw Massacre remakes for example..). However, since I haven't seen the original Stepfather film I can't compare them both, but what I have seen in this remake is something else. I was really, really impressed with this, and I am going to have to seek out the original now to see what it was like.The Stepfather basically tells the story of \"David\" - a disturbed man who is apparently normal and caring on the outside but very unstable on the inside, both psychologically and emotionally and one of who lives a lot double lives, looking for recently divorced women to emotionally manipulate them and ultimately, breaks them down and kills them and any immediate family. I always compare him to the girl out of the Orphan because they both have nearly the same tactics at luring people into trusting them - in fact this movie reminded me of Orphan a lot. Anyway, when he senses he may be in danger of having his history found out, \"David\" takes even more extreme action to cover his steps up a lot quicker than he would normally do. \"David\" has been doing this many for years, and also has evaded capture from the police by changing his appearance and never using any ID when purchasing, for example a car. He always pays in cash, and always changes his appearance in somewhat way before moving onto his next victim. You may think it's a relatively simple plot, but the movie itself is a lot of fun and suspense. There's also a lot of psychological tension and build up as \"David\"'s new family become suspicious of his activities and his apparent lack of background information. As the movie progresses, things turn for the worse for the family he has deceived as they become wary of his background.The acting is first class, and the guy who acts as \"David\", Dylan Walsh? I think that's his name....   \n",

I like it because of the advanced technology used in the movie, I have watched it a lot of times. Some people say it is a bad movie, but my opinion is that it is a great movie. The bad thing is that I find it boring sometimes, probably because I watched it a lot. I also really like the Terminator T- X. I really recommend that movie. It is in my list of favorite movies. I also think that it is some of the best Terminator movies. I try to never miss it on TV. I enjoy watching it with my friends and family. The first time I watched it was in late 2003, shortly after it was released. I cannot really describe it.   \n",
       "123915  This was a funny and - near the end - a touching movie. That's a nice combination to have. My only complaint is that it certainly isn't \"family fare\" for a nice story and should have been rated \"R,\" not PG-13. There's simply too much sexual material (and and f-word) for PG-13. With some editing, this could have been a great story for everyone.However, for us adults who like to laugh, there is plenty in here to do that. The jokes come pretty fast, right from the get-go. The premise would good: with a (television-like) remote control, you could control your life. You could fast-forward through all the unpleasant scenes in your life, or freeze frame something that is happening now, or you could go back into time with your life. It all sounds good, but as our main character \"Michael Newman\" (Adam Sandler) found out, it's not so cool. That's a key message here, too, that avoiding the bad things is not necessarily what's best for us. The major message, however, was that spending time with your family is more important than putting your job ahead of them, as far as priorities go. That theme leads to some touching scenes in the final 30 minutes of this comedy. As funny as this film is, you would be hard-pressed not to have some tears in your eyes at some point near the end of this film.Sandler plays a typical role for him, and utters some great lines and uses sight gags as well for plenty of his laughs. Kate Bekinsale, who plays his wife \"Donna,\" looks absolutely beautiful, the prettiest I've seen her since \"Pearl Harbor.\" She plays a nice lady in here, too. Their little kids - especially the girl (Tatum McCann) - are cute and funny at times. I won't mention the dog. I can't without being crude. Christopher Walken is here, and that usually means good news as he tends to play fun-and-interesting characters. Unfortunately - just a warning - this comedy, as so many modern-day ones are, has its share of crude moments, some language and the above-mentioned sexual material. O...   \n",

I often wonder why some people even bother going to movies. They over analyze and criticize every movie. I however love to enjoy movies at face value. I won't lie, to date no terminator movie after T2 has even come close to making me feel exited watching it the first time the way T2 did, until now.I thought this latest movie was fantastic, and I was not alone. I saw a preview screening with about 20% normal people and 80% press last night. It was obvious throughout the movie that the audience was very into the movie and at the end it got a standing ovation. What does that tell you? I could not wait for what came next.It won't surprise me a bit if half those reviewers that stood and clapped give the movie a bad review because thats what they do, or they think they are expected to do.Don't listen to reviews or the haters. Go see this movie while you can on the big screen. If you liked the first 2 movies this movie is very much more along those lines than the other sequels. Arnold being old fits great! The story is fantastic. The effects fantastic. Casting fantastic. For the first time in a long time I actually felt like I saw special effects I have not seen before.This movie deserves your attendance. Go have fun! I may go see it again this weekend.   \n",

As expected, things didn't reach so far into a philosophical sphere and at times spelling out the \"dilemmas of existence for dummies\" took a little from the atmosphere of the film.But, as far as bad things go, that's about it. CGI were mostly spot- on, only one or two scenes pulled me out of immersion. As a big plus, the film took some time to actually present the world itself without jumping to action. Side characters were great, I enjoyed Aramaki and Batou the most, Togusa, Saito and Ishikawa didn't have much screen time, but still delivered. Now, Johansson as the Major, I know a lot of fuss was there about whitewashing, I don't care about SJW thing, what matters to me if an actor/ess can act the role and IMO she was a great choice. In most scenes she behaved exactly like her character should, it didn't feel forced or overacted to me.And for the plot itself, I'm not saying it was fresh or never seen before thing, but it was a nice take and it brought something to the franchise. IDK if it makes official canon, but in my head it already is.I hope this review helps you, it is my first and I've done it because I feel that 6.9 stars is a lot less than this effort deserves.   \n",
       "124271  The original Transporter is one one of my favorite films. Its mindless fun with great characters that makes me stop every time I run across it while channel surf. How could they top it? Apparently quite easily.The plot of the movie has Frank relocated back to the US, Miami in particular, where he is filling in for a friend who is the driver for the family of a federal drug official. During his time filling in he has grown close to the young son of the family and promises not to let anyone hurt him. Of course the boy is kidnapped and Frank is not only a suspect, he's also the only one who can save the boy and stop the real plot which involves mass murder.The key thing to understand about this film is that it is completely fantastic and unreal. The stunts, the plot, the whole thing, is completely impossible. If you can accept that fact and just go with it the you'll have a great time. If you want reality in your movies stay home, this movie is completely unreal.The action is spectacular, and the film makers have out done themselves. Its amazing. Everything about the fights and chases is absolutely first rate.The characters are great. Frank is the same great character from the first film. We get to see him actually grow as a person. We feel for him as we see him act as the frantic surrogate father, and our heart breaks as we see somethings go wrong. Taconi, the police inspector is back, and is a joy to behold. I wish that he was better used, but just having him on screen is enough for me.The villains are monstrous people who will do anything to anyone for money or pleasure. They are truly suitable foils for our hero. They are so good, that you never know from the get go how bad things are going to get, or if Frank will actually get out of this alive. Its so nice to have bad guys you can really hate.The plot is much tighter than in the first film, which completely broke down about half way in. Sure, the first movie was fun to the end, but you had to ignore the fact ...   \n",
       "124528  The most popular team of detectives in cinematic history is back again, making the streets of Los Angeles safe and secure for the citizens at large in `Lethal Weapon 3,' directed by Richard Donner and once again starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover.  This time the action literally starts with a bang (a big one) when Riggs (Gibson) and Murtaugh (Glover) answer a call and, suffice to say, Riggs can't wait for the bomb squad to arrive.  It makes for a spectacular opening scene, but it's just a warm up for what follows.  Some bad things are going down in the City of Angels, perhaps not unusual for L.A., but someone is putting automatic weapons and armor piercing bullets (called `Cop Killers' as they can penetrate a bullet proof vest) on the streets, which is really bad news for police officers in general, and especially for those in particular areas of the city.  Riggs and Murtaugh are on the case, but it quickly escalates, and because of certain untoward circumstances soon falls into the hands of Internal Affairs.  Which brings Officer Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) into the picture.  And sparks begin to fly. \\tThe first two installments of this series are hard to beat, but as they say, the third time's a charm; and Donner must have had the shaman working with him on this one, because he pulled off quite a feat-- making a third that ranks right up there with the first two.  He seems to have found the perfect balance with this one; the main characters are in place and established, Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) is back, and the addition of Russo is the icing on the cake.  The story is good, there's plenty of great action and some sensational stunts, and the humor has been toned down a notch, which increases the level of intensity of the drama.  In short, Donner measures out all of the right elements to perfection and makes it all gel together for the complete package.  And what a package it is. \\tBy now, Gibson IS Riggs, from the inside out; still somewhat on the edge, but not quite...   \n",
       "124616  It's been five years from \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" debuted on theaters. The Pevensies have grown up. The first movie would see a very young Lucy still with a cute face like a first-grader. In this movie, she looks like she's in seventh grade or eight grade. Seems like time flows like Narnian time here. \"Voyage of the Dawn Treader\" marks the third film in the Narnia franchise. It follows King Caspian in a journey to find the seven lost lords of Narnia whom King Miraz banished during his reign in the previous film with his ship, the Dawn Treader. On the way, he met Edmund, Lucy and their pathetic cousin, Eustace Scrubb who turned out to have a change in the movie. However, there's this horrifying green mist that can tempt you to do things that can lead up to bad things and the whereabouts of these lost lords are unknown. So, these people take on a journey that passes the beyond the Silver Sea (which must be really somewhere very east) and to the \"End of the World\". END of the world not those doomsday things.\"Voyage\" is actually a very enjoyable film for both kids and adults alike. The adventures were really great and breathtaking and should be a good way to take people's spare time. Its story is understandable for young kids and its characters are enjoyable and fun to befriend with especially the mouse, Reepicheep. \"Voyage\" will actually give good laughs to its audience with its jokes especially with the appearance of the Pevensies' coward, pathetic Eustace Scrubb who actually changed ever since he visited Narnia. His actions are the main source of laughs here. His acting also maximized the laughs in this film and I think comedy is what strengthens this movie. \"Voyage\" is also powerful in exciting action scenes. This is what seems to be lacking in the previous films even in the climax where it doesn't seem that exciting. \"Voyage's\" climax is very exciting and deserves to be called a climax. The setting of the scene was well-suited and the scene was s...   \n",
       "124678  You may have to be a believer (Jewish or Christian) to like this film, although some secular (at least middle-aged midwestern) Jews and others may find it worthwhile for the period details. It is a modern version of the book of Job, which--of course you remember--contains a prologue in which God and Satan bet on whether Job will remain faithful and Satan then strikes down Job's flocks, children, and health; a series of speeches by three comforters with Job's responses; a speech by Elihu who is unhappy with the advice of the three comforters; the Lord himself answering Job directly out of the whirlwind ('who is this who darkens counsel by words without knowledge?'); a final submissive speech by Job ('I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye see thee, wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes'); and an epilogue in which Job receives more flocks and children (...) than he had before.The book and the film address what (Christian, at least) theologians call theodicy, or how bad things can happen in the world when God, who supposedly controls everything, is supposedly good. For nonbelievers (if you have any interest in the subject), the best way to think of this is perhaps to ask yourself whether the universe (the Creation) is on balance a good thing ('and God saw that it was good'). If so, then perhaps we somehow have an obligation to live moral lives and (as Jews and Christians think of it) to follow God's law. If not, then perhaps it's every man for himself and the Devil take the hindmost.The Coens' answer, if I understand it correctly, comes out of the whirlwind at the end in the voice of Grace Slick. I personally prefer God's original response with its paean to astrophysics and evolutionary biology--'Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? ... When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? ... Gave you wings and feathers unto the ostrich? Who leaves her eggs in the earth, and wa...   \n",
       "124693  Many people like to generalize things to make it easier to understand the world. When the trailer for MAGIC MIKE was revealed, it was labeled as just a \"male stripper movie,\" like how BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN was just a \"gay cowboy movie.\" This generic label, undermining and downgrading the film's actual quality, even overshadows the fact that Steven Soderbergh is the director, who rarely make films that lack substance. Yes, MAGIC MIKE has style, but it has substance as well. Here's the kicker: Those who want to see the film primarily for the stripping may be left disappointed, as they will likely fidget in their seats for these scenes to come. As one lady sitting next to me said once the credits rolled, \"Worst movie ever.\" On the other hand, those who refuse to see the film because of its subject matter may be missing a great film.To state it simply, MAGIC MIKE is a BOOGIE NIGHTS-lite, which isn't a bad thing considering how utterly dark and depressing BOOGIE NIGHTS gets in its second half. The first half of MAGIC MIKE is light and breezy and quite funny. In fact, most of the jokes in here are funnier than most modern comedies try to achieve. We are introduced to this world that is fascinating because of how surprisingly mundane and economics-centered it is. The stripping sequences, filled with energy and sexiness, are mostly played for laughs. We get exposed to a lot of male asses, ripped abs, and pelvic thrusts, but it's all in good fun. Then, things slowly start to take a dark turn in the second half. It isn't hard to imagine people thinking, \"Wait. Isn't this a stripping movie?\" Characters start to make bad decisions and one thing leads to another and so on. You get the idea.The cast is terrific all around. Channing Tatum is very good as the lead role, playing comedy and drama effectively. However, I want to give a huge shout out to Alex Pettyfr and Cody Horn, both pulling off terrific performances in their substantial roles. Pettyfr, in particular, I never reall...   \n",

I thought the filmmakers handled this movie very intelligently and brilliantly. They put a strong emphasis on building a super creepy atmosphere rather than focus on pointless blood and gore. Because of this, you're on edge pretty much the whole time. I can't say it's the scariest thing I've ever seen, but it was certainly nerve wracking throughout. The plot of the movie revolves around a brother and sister trying to prove that this weird mirror is haunted and is responsible for many deaths over the years, including their father's death. This mirror makes you see things that aren't really happening and it screws with your perception of reality. It makes the main characters kind of lose it mentally. The film loses structure and coherency as the the character's minds deteriorate, and that isn't a bad thing at all. It adds to the movie really. I thought the correlation between their state of mind and the film's structure was pretty cool. Also, the child actors in this movie are fantastic. They were never annoying and the way they acted like normal children (for the most part). That being said, it isn't flawless. You could watch this and completely hate it. I could definitely see the overall confusing narrative turning people away. It's a fairly subjective movie I think. You could love it or hate it. That being said, I personally loved it and I think people should see it.   \n",

It felt a little weird for a movie but they pulled it off. only bad thing for me was the length of the movie. there were slow parts but it didn't ruin it. It continued to be funny even until the end.SOOOO many guest stars. if you like seeing stars out of their natural habitat you will enjoy this. even youtube's Bo Burnum was in it.it was even odder that the audience wasn't really suppose to like the main character (george). it was just a completely different type of movie that i can understand if some people don't get into it.I give it an A and i suggest it to all comedy fans. It definitely wasn't predictable... or unpredictable. You'll see.   \n",
       "124879  Full of theories on life and enough ideas to cause you to rethink your own ideas, The Giver is an intense film about the effects of accepting the good and bad things memories of life. Being a huge Meryl Streep fan (Chief Elder), I was very excited to see her performance and, I was not disappointed. Jeff Bridges' (The Giver) performance gives this film a veteran presence that adds to the wisdom their characters possess. As for Brenton Thwaites (Jonas) and Odeya Rush (Fiona), their performances show great promise for their careers. Their youth and lack of experience add a sense of naÃ¯vetÃ© to their characters that beautifully contradicts with the characters played by both Streep and Bridges. I find the script a bit pretentious but necessarily so. The premise itself is very complex but suitable for the subject matter. What could have 90 minutes of melodrama turns into brilliant and intelligent conversations thanks to the skills of the ensemble. I give an Oscar nod for both Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges.There is a scene towards the end of the film where The Giver and Chief Elder debate on the pros and cons of memories and allowing people to make decisions. That is one of the very best acted scenes I've seen this year. The dialogue is so poetic that we're drawn into the fantasy instead of repulsed by its theatrical nature.My favorite part of the film, second to Meryl's performance, is the beautiful cinematography by Ross Emery. Mr. Emery and Editor Barry Alexander Brown really come together wonderfully to create awesome moments of visual storytelling. The mixture of black and white with color, and the short shots of real life events give this film a certain vivacity the book is unable to give.This film is really quite an achievement. To bring such a loved and popular book, with tons of deep ideas and themes, and execute as wonderfully as Director Philip Noyce and company do, is great. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars and really hope you see it. It opens theatricall...   \n",

Many action fans really loved this movie, as well as fans of the first Beverly Hills Cop film.One of the reasons why Beverly Hills Cop 2 is such a great sequel is because of the return of the stars from the first film. Eddie Murphy is back, as well as Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, and Ronny Cox. In addition to them, some new characters are introduced such as Brigitte Nielsen & Jurgen Prochnow as the new villains, and the cute Alice Adair as Ronny Cox's daughter in the film.Another reason why this sequel is good is because of the way the action and comedy scenes are balanced. While not as funny as the first film, Beverly Hills Cop 2 has a nice balanced blend of action and comedy. This means that both action & comedy fans will love this movie.Here is the final reason that this sequel is good: So many great cameos are featured in the film! There are cameos by Paul Reiser (again), Gilbert Gottfried, Chris Rock, Hugh Hefner, Carrie Leigh, and DOZENS of sexy Playboy Playmates! Perhaps the only bad thing about the film is that there were many noticeable mistakes in editing. However, upon watching this movie more than 5 times, I got over the mistakes and managed to look past them. The good things about this movie far outweigh its disadvantages.To sum up, I strongly recommend this film to those who loved the first movie. It is a truly great sequel, one of the greatest movie sequels of all time. It follows very closely to the first film, and has an 80's feel to it just like the first movie. Don't miss those great cameos!   \n",

The review was dismissive and made a lot of sense, so I decided to give it a miss. What a terrible mistake! This is a movie I would love to see on a big screen. The script is so brilliantly clever. Disguised as a silly comedy there is a world of serious themes executed by a knowing cast. Meryl Streep in particular, playing convincingly an actress without talent. I remember the bad review criticized the writers for setting the story in a rainy, stormy Los Angeles when California was going through a drought. Imagine if a comedy about magic potions should worry about the accuracy of the weather. In fact the Los Angeles of \"Death Becomes Her\" feels more like Los Angelers than most realistic movies and it does it with nerve and wit. \"In 12 years in Los Angeles have you ever seen a neighbor?\" screams Meryl to his mousy Bruce. An absolute delight. Other hidden treasures are a cameo from Sidney Pollack and a very funny and very sexy \"76 years old\" Isabella Rossellini. A new cult classic and a total must.   \n",

No one can deny that van damme is a great martial artist, but his acting is so so the opposite.You have to look at it as a martial arts film (which it is) and accept the stunning fight sequences (especially the final fight scene which was very well choreographed) the film offers.Yes, people will talk about how bad his acting may be, but what people forget is that he is a martial artist more than an actor. Movies are just the way he can express his great skills to an audience.I recommend this film to any martial arts fan but not so much to anyone looking for a compelling dramatic, mystical thriller because you will be disappointed.On all it's a basic, pure, martial arts film that i feel is underrated.   \n",

In my opinion, John Travolta deserved at least a nomination for an Oscar here, if not the award itself. The story was decent, but the performances of Travolta, Forest Whitaker, Robert Duvall, and Kyra Sedgwick made me care about what was happening on the screen. By no means is this a romantic comedy. It's romantic, probably the most romantic film I have seen in a long time. The reason for that is simple...it's real. In most movies you see the main characters sleep together within a day at the most, which rarely happens with two people who are really in love. True love has to take time and effort, which is exactly what you see here. Travolta's George is patient, but not because he wants to be. If you're a romantic at heart you will understand and relate to him, and you will hope for his success as you would for your own. Without giving anything away, I will tell you that the ending is sad, but also heartwarming. George has his \"experience\" for no other reason than to suggest what we as humans can become. Phenomenon is a story about our potential, the good and bad things that can happen to us if we achieve it. We could only be so lucky, and watching the movie is a good start. I give it 8 out of 10 stars.   \n",
       "126020  \"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadow\" picks up where the prequel left off; Holmes is tracking down Professor Moriarty, a man he believes is responsible for a series of bombings and mysterious deaths around world. With the help of his pal Watson (off to be married soon), and a gang of gypsies, which includes The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's Noomi Rapace, set out on a game of cat-and-mouse to find the schemes of the sinister Professor.Though there is an element of mystery in this film, it is not as in-depth as the first film. Rather the focus is on the action sequences and clever humor. This is not necessarily a bad thing though; in fact it helps move the plot along. The first film suffered because the story was slow. In this Holmes though, there is not one second that drags. The story itself is not special, but its pace is what counts. Walking out of the theater, I felt refreshed and glad that I saw this movie. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are once again a true treat to watch as Holmes and Watson. Their chemistry and interactions are perfect; it's easy to tell that both had fun with the script and with each other. Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty gives a solid performance, as a cold, manipulative, power hungry villain. Unlike Mark Strong in the first film, he is a believable antagonist. Noomi Rapace is a nice flavor as Madam Sim. The set and costume designs are exquisite, bringing to life of what Europe was like in the late 1800s. I smell Oscar for these departments. The sound and editing is crisply done, and the music is top-notchedâHans, you're truly the best. The visual effects are mostly good, but some scenes were a bit over the top and borderline ridiculous. One of many examples include a woman being thrown from a fast moving train into a river, without sustaining injury or even dying. This is impossible. Then again, it's Hollywood. The filmmakers aren't doing their job if a sense of the ridiculous is not thrown into an action flick from time to time. \"...   \n",

How to train your dragon 2 was previously my favourite animated film of the year.. that was until i saw this gem.The story follows a smart kid named Hiro who is suffering from kid depression after his brother is killed in a huge fire. This is where he meets Baymax, the star of the film and possibly my favourite Disney character since Olaf the snowman. Baymax is a big lovable idiot-type robot who was built to provide healthcare for humans. Hiro sees Baymax as a chance to get revenge on his brother's killer and with him and his new- found friends they embark on a journey to get justice.Some of the film's best scenes come from Hiro's attempts to turn Baymax into a badass fighting machine. This results in hilarious moments because we still have our big lovable idiot.. but now he has awesome superpowers, and i must say this kept me thoroughly entertained. The other characters were also awesome and each had their own personality traits but at the end we are left with the relationship between Hiro and Baymax, although definitely not a bad thing because as an audience we can never have enough Baymax.I did feel that this film suffered from what Guardians of the Galaxy also suffered with which is that the villain was underdeveloped, although unlike Ronan the villain in this film (no spoilers) did have a fleshed out plan and was quite a surprise twist. In the end I came out of Big Hero 6 feeling satisfied and entertained, featuring the humour of Marvel and the heart of Disney, this one is well worth a watch for people of all ages and if you don't want your own personal Baymax by the end then something must be wrong with you!   \n",

So the Spacey film would have depicted events near the end of this film. Both are superb movies.Back to the review. This film is very unusual in that the producers have shown fierce determination in taking a serious topic and making it as user friendly as one possibly can. Multiple techniques are used to this end and they all work well. In fact in places the film has a Monty Python quality. Why was this done? One can only assume that the producers understood the multiple studies showing that the modern city-dweller becomes uncomfortable when confronted with any facts which suggest that he or she was not paying attention when bad things were happening. After all we live in a democracy so the voters should have been more alert? Isn't that their job? The techniques mentioned attempt to appeal to our SESAME STREET side and make the whole thing as pleasant an educational experience as possible. But make no mistake, this is an educational movie.One that should be mandatory for adults. Like getting a driving test before a license. How about learning about Wall Street and the banks before you invest with them...? Carell steals the film and may finally get the attention he deserves. Great actor.Finally the message. The film suggests not only that Wall Street is corrupt but that the corruption extends to the agencies mandated to supervise Wall Street and (possibly) to Washington itself. The implicit message, conveyed in the end credits, that unless we deal with the problem at the source the symptoms will keep happening over and over and over.Duh!   \n",

Cage delivered on the \"anti-hero\" - a 21st century \"Corleone\". The locations were cool and \"spectacular\". From a visual standpoint this movie really does take you around the world. New York, Russia, Libya, Libera, etc. This movie is shot very, very well.The pacing of the movie is brisk, the scenes aren't morose. Like Platoon, this movie doesn't glamorize or demonize situations. A guy who sells weapons for a living meets some violent people in some violent places. The visual style is breathtaking . . . What I like best is, no characters in the movie are \"romanticized\". There are no \"good guys\". One could make the case that there are no \"bad guys\" as well I suppose. There are people who do bad things for reasons you don't understand. There are people who do nothing when they should do something for reasons you don't understand. Its a pretty accurate depiction of real life :)I think I might have rated the movie 8.5, if there were any other movies at all about this topic that were anywhere in its league. If you make a great \"Legally Blond\", that's nice. If you make a great movie about arms trading with a sold antihero and supporting characters, I figure you get \"extra credit\".I think you're a fool if you miss this movie. Its not about Iraq. Its not particularly political. This movie could have been made under any president in the last 100 years and been just as accurate. Its not particularly anti-gun. Its just about this guy who sells guns. On the other hand, don't take people to this movie if they can't handle violence or movies that aren't designed to make them \"feel good\" when they walk out. This is a good movie, its interesting, its intelligent, its important -- but its not Ferris Buellers Day Off or Spinal Tap.   \n",

I have to admit that I had my doubts. I heard some bad things about this movie from my friends. I had bought the movie for my mom, and she said just to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. \"Red Dragon\" goes back into the roots that \"Silence of the Lambs\" did. It had high action and drama. I was very impressed. And Anthony Hopkins does a great job as his most famous role as Hannibal Lector. I really have to say that I didn't stick to my friend's opinions. This was a great movie. I would recommend for the \"Silence of the Lambs\" fans.9/10   \n",

Big Wow. Boy did I enjoy this film. The story-line is a cross between The Fugitive and a human heist plot movie. There were moments where I genuinely really didn't know which way the story would end. Has to be one of the best, if not the best film I've seen this year.I just had to watch right through to the end. The only down side, were the roles of the 2 main cops. I'm not sure if 2 real cops would be as persistent. But I guess if they weren't, then the film would be a fair bit shorter.I can't think of any other bad things about it, as it does what it is supposed to do, make you care about the characters and keep you gripped till the end. All in all very entertaining. Definitely worth watching.   \n",
       "127434  I saw it at a German press screening. Without giving too much away: Most critics really seemed to like it very much. There was even applause afterwards, which is quite unusual for that species. From my point of view and until now, it was the funniest movie of the year. It keeps the charm and wit of the three W+G shorts and it is enlarged with many references to these and other movies. Of course, there are obvious allusions to monster- and werewolf-movies, especially to \"An American Werewolf in London\", \"Jaws\", \"King Kong\" and even to Peter Jackson's \"Braindead\"/\"Dead Alive\", but also to other genres.Characterization was better done in \"Chicken Run\", but that movie had a complete new \"cast\" where introduction was necessary. Here, you are already able to know the two main characters. So, the new \"Wallace and Gromit\"-movie is enjoyed best if you watched (and liked) the shorts already, yet it also works on its own. \"Chicken Run\" had the more convenient, but also more \"storytelling\" plot. Instead, this new Aardman masterpiece keeps that crazier and somehow more \"isolated\" feeling of the W+G shorts. Children should also enjoy it very much, especially because of the sweet rabbits (if you love cute bunnies, this is a must-see for you!!!) and because Gromit has a lot do to and really steals the show (children also love dogs... :-) ). But many jokes are thought for a more adult audience (there are even soft sexual allusions in it). The movie manages, like \"Shrek 1+2\" and \"The Incredibles\", to fulfil high level entertainment for the whole family, with adding a British and at least a little bit darker edge to the humour of American animated movies.The animation is Â as expected Â superb, and they kept true to the Aardman style because they didn't put in too many digital effects - I realized just a few when it came to Wallace's inventions.Finally, the score works fine in the movie, although one of the main themes definitely is \"borrowed\" by Randy Edelman's \"Dragonheart\" sc...   \n",
       "127495  I have a strong feeling that what you think of this film will strongly depend on your frame of reference. If you've never seen a Miyazaki film before, then it will probably confuse the heck out of you. If you have seen a Miyazaki film before, then it will still probably confuse the heck out of you....but you won't really care! That's because I found that the first time I saw one of his animated films, I tried too hard to figure out what was happening and why--and it impacted my enjoyment of the film. Now that I have seen just about every Miyazaki film, I see the bizarreness and just take it all in--enjoying the beauty of it all. In many ways, these films (at least to Western audiences) is like drugs--lots of strange and beautiful images that don't always initially make sense but sure feel great to see!! Of all the Miyazaki films, this might have the most unusual and incomprehensible story line--even more so than SPIRITED AWAY and PRINCESS MONONOKE or MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO. But, like these and many other Studio Gibli films, if you just sit back and watch you are rewarded with a fabulous tale. But, because it is so hard to describe (and others have already done so), I won't even go there.As for the artwork, it's very typical of one of these Japanese films, though there was one noticeable change. There was a very extensive use of what looked like colored pencils for the backgrounds. This was NOT a bad thing at all--the lovely pastel-like look was very pleasing and unique. In some ways it looked like a tiny bit of Bill Plympton's art style was infused into a typical Miyazaki film. With a high frame-rate, exceptional character animation (which imbued them with tons of personality) and a great \"wow-factor\", this is an exceptional film for all ages. Though clearly designed more for younger audiences (the TOTORO fans especially), it is a bit scary here and there (during the storm segments) but there is plenty of great stuff for adults. As an adult (at least chronologically...   \n",
       "127587                Alfonso Cuaron's Y Tu Mama Bien is one of the better films of the year (not quite best, but still highly recommendable). Cuaron, who scripted with his brother Carlos, tells a story with such a level of stark and touching realism that the audience will not only feel for the three main characters, but will feel like their along the ride with them. In this story, Tenoch and Julio are two friends whose girlfriends go away to Italy for a little while and are left with not much to do (outside of partying and masturbation) until they get an idea to go to a secluded beach called Heaven's Mouth and ask the married and 10 years older Luisa to come along. She agrees after discovering her husband cheated on her more than she could stand and this takes the movie onto a road trip with dialog and actions that, despite having the be read on the bottom of the screen in subtitle format, is much better than most teen movies that go for sex related dialog (however, Cuaron had to go back to Mexico to make this type of movie so that the MPAA wouldn't s*** on it and make him re-edit it to a NC-17) and action. The only flaws keeping Cuaron's latest work from being a great coming of age tale is that the narration, while keeping in some good insight along the way, becomes heavy handed at times and gives information that is either humorist news along the area the characters are traveling or about the characters themselves which isn't a bad thing until it digs into things that don't have much relevance to the rest of the picture or even to the characters when you think about what is really up on the screen. Plus, the very last scene is too conventional to be placed as where the film leads up to (he should've ended it when Luisa goes into the ocean the last time).But still, these squabbles shouldn't stop people from seeing this movie, overall it delivers splendidly in it's uninhibited and mature ways. Props also go to the performances by the three leads and to the cinematography.   \n",

I've noticed in the low rated comments one of the main reasons people didn't like the film is because the main character isn't likeable. And though I loved the film, I would agree; she isn't likeable. And the film is more realistic and better off for it. In real life we aren't always likeable people ourselves and the film almost acts as a tool to allow us to step back and really look at our current or teenage selves. Nadine does realise and understand towards the end and throughout the film her erratic and selfish behaviour is a result of her self loathing because she knows she doesn't want to continue being that way but she's stuck in this endless cycle and doesn't know how to get out. The valuable lesson from the film and her journey within it is that we often bring misfortune and unhappiness on ourselves in the way we handle and respond to bad things in our lives. I think this film will speak to anyone who has felt alone in the world, lost without purpose or anywhere to fit in. If you like films about people rather than action and you watch a film to be taken on a journey (albeit an emotional one) rather than to have an enjoyable couple of hours then this may be the film for you. It helps that is has an excellent cast, each actor fitting their roles well and bringing them to life.Another positive note I took away from the film is the way it handles and represents mental illness/ distress as it does so without labels and in a subtle way without needing to bring it to the forefront.   \n",

Harry Caul (Hackman) is at the top of his business, but he's disturbed.  Highly paranoiac, he is troubled by bad things that happened to some innocent people as a result of a prior surveillance job.  Now he's afraid it's happening again....The Conversation could not be more antithetical of the current movie making style.  Stark, claustrophobic, unsexy, slow-paced, and with almost no soundtrack, it slowly builds to its dramatic noirish denouement.A real treat, and as an added attraction the actors include a young Cindy Williams, Terri Garr, John Cazale, and Harrison Ford.  Worth the rental unless anything outside of the MTV mould causes agitation.   \n",
       "127857  As a last film for a truly legendary director, Before The Devil Knows You're Dead can only be described as a haunting, underrated masterpiece that any viewer will not soon forget.

Delivering a powerful message through spurts of violence and intensity while never straying from the realm of reality within the movie. The violence and thrills are handled very well and are, at t...   \n",
